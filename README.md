### Hi there, I'm Hasham! ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science major at Amherst College, graduating in December 2023. I love solving challenging problems by writing great code and am looking to apply to full-time software engineer roles nationwide. I am eager to join a company at the frontier of innovation that can help foster my skills and intellectual curiosity.

My most recent project: [A QD-TEM Analyzer](https://github.com/hwarrich/QD-TEM-Analyzer)
