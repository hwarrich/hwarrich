### Hi there, I'm Hasham! ðŸ‘‹

I love solving challenging problems by writing great code and am looking to apply to full-time software engineer roles nationwide. I am eager to join a company at the frontier of innovation that can help foster my skills and intellectual curiosity. I have previous experience at American Express building backends with Golang and Java. Prior to that I was a computer science major and TA at Amherst College.
